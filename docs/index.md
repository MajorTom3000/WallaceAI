### Welcome to our 175 project in AI respository. Before introducing anything further, let me tell you the story of our agent, Wallace, and how it turns into a legend.

## Background Story of the agent

<img src="img/mike_wallace.jpg" width="30%">

Mike Wallace, was a world famous journalist who was born in a Jewish family in Massachusetts on May 9, 1918. During his life time, he had interviewed lots of presidents throughout the world, including eight presidents of the United States, Putin, Xiaopin Deng, and Zeming Jiang. Among all of these interviews, the interview with President Jiang was one of the most famous ones, and it has been influencing generations of Chinese people until today. However, nobody knows the story that happened right before the interview.

Just three days before the interview, Wallace was arrested by the police for no reason, and they put him in prison right away without even giving him a chance to speak in court. If Wallace is a normal person, then he might have given up the great chance to speak with the president Jiang, but he did not want to surrender to the fate. Therefore, he decided to break out of the prison on his own. By all means, he succeeded at the end, and arrived Beijing on time.

Our project is trying to illustrate the story that happened inside of the prison that Wallace was in at that time. The agent is representation of Wallace.
